## üèÅ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine. Using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager) is recommended.

### Firebase Setup

1.  Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Create a new Web App in your Firebase project.
3.  Copy the `firebaseConfig` object from your project settings.
4.  This project is set up to load Firebase configuration at runtime. You will need to make your configuration available through a script or environment variables that set the `window.__firebase_config` variable.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
    cd certiflash-quest-forge
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, and you can view your application at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy).

## üìÇ Project Structure

The main application code is located in the `src/` directory:

-   `src/components/`: Contains all the React components, including UI elements from `shadcn/ui` and custom components like `QuizPage`, `ProgressDashboard`, and `ModulesGrid`.
-   `src/data/`: Includes the raw quiz data (`awsMLQuestions.ts`) before it's synced to Firestore.
-   `src/pages/`: Contains the main page components that are mapped to routes. `Index.tsx` is the core of the application.
-   `src/lib/`: Utility functions.
-   `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that sets up routing and global providers.
-   `src/main.tsx`: The entry point of the React application.
